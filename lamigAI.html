            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. AI is revolutionizing various industries, from healthcare to finance, by automating processes and providing valuable insights. </p>

            <h2>Types of AI</h2>
            <p>AI can be broadly classified into several types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</strong> Designed and trained for a particular task (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).</li>
                <li><strong>General AI (Strong AI):</strong> Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge to solve any problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Superintelligence:</strong> A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence.</li>
            </ul>
